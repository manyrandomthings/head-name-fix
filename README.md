# Head name fix

This mod will save the name of named player and mob heads when you place them down and pick them back up.  
This mod also requires a datapack to work (see releases tab)  

Works well with More Mob Heads and Wandering Trades from [vanillatweaks](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
